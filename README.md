# Deployment Formatter (Built in React)

The Deployment Formatter was created to make it easier to quickly generate the various strings used throughout the process, rather than manually typing them out every time.

Once the necessary details have been entered, they can quickly be copied to clipboard and pasted into wherever the user keeps their deployment notes.

## Version Requirements

- Built in React 18, not yet tested at lower versions
- Uses v1.3.1 of the Digital Scotland Design System

## Planned Improvements

Styling changes to improve general layout and presentation of information, especially the generated list of deployment strings.

## Startup

In the project directory, run:

### `npm i`

Installs all necessary dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
